Hello there!! Here i have added all the codes that I have solved in my DAA as a part of my course. I had faced many problems in questions, specially graph m-color was new to me when I found it as a part in Final Lab Evaluation. I couldnt solve then but later realized where I had been wrong. I rectified ALL MY MISTAKES. Hereby uploading the solutions to keep me tracked about the stupid mistakes I made that turned out to be an issue. These have been uploaded on my GitHub as well. U can access them from there as well. I just uploaded my certain codes which I forgot to add earlier.
